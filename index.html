<h1>So you want to test my app, eh?</h1>

<ol>
<li>Double check you have iOS 13 installed by going to Settings -> General -> About</li>
<li><a href="https://betafamily.com/register-device/token/0d2a29f9">Open this link from your iPhone/></li>
<li>Install the configuration profile by tapping "Allow".</li>
<li>Open Settings app and tap on "Profile Downloaded". Ignore the warnings and tap "Install" until it dismisses.</li>
<li>You should now see a website with your device info. Send me the "Udid" string by copy/pasting it into chat or using the email feature. My email is erikvillegas1@gmail.com.</li>
