<h1>So you want to test my app, eh?</h1>

1. Double check you have iOS 13 installed by going to Settings -> General -> About
2. <a href="https://betafamily.com/register-device/token/0d2a29f9">Open this link from your iPhone/>
3. Install the configuration profile by tapping "Allow".
4. Open Settings app and tap on "Profile Downloaded". Ignore the warnings and tap "Install" until it dismisses.
5. You should now see a website with your device info. Send me the "Udid" string by copy/pasting it into chat or using the email feature. My email is erikvillegas1@gmail.com.
