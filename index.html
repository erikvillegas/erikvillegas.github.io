  <h1>So you want to try out my app, eh?</h1>

  <a>Since this app isn't on the App Store yet, we have to do a little dance to get this installed on your specific device. Follow the steps below to get the identifier of your device</a>

  <ol>
    <li>Double check you have iOS 13 installed by going to Settings → General → About</li>
    <li>Open <a href="https://betafamily.com/register-device/token/0d2a29f9">this link</a> from your iPhone</li>
    <li>Install the configuration profile by tapping "Allow".</li>
    <li>Open Settings app and tap on "Profile Downloaded". Ignore the warnings and tap "Install" until it dismisses. Don't worry, nothing bad will happen.</li>
    <li>You should now see a website with your device info. Send me the "Udid" string by copy/pasting it into chat or using the email feature. My email is erikvillegas1@gmail.com.</li>
  </ol>

  <a>Once I have everyone's ID, I'll send you a link to download the app!</a>
